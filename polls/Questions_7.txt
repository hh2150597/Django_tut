Few Questions about the admin site:

1. We write some code in admin.py, and similarly, we use @admin.display in models.py. What is the difference between them, and which one is the better way to render things on the admin panel?

2. Let's suppose we create a login system in our app. For storing user data in the database, should we use the admin user field, or should we use the app database?
